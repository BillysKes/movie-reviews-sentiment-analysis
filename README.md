<h1>Description</h1> 

The aim of this sentiment analysis project is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content. We utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to help us perform the analysis, which provides us with the dataset and also with preprocessing tools for data cleaning and transformation. After the transformation of the data with the BagOfWords(BOW) model, we classifiy them with the Support Vector Machine(SVM).




<h1>Dataset</h1>
In this project we use the nltk movie-reviews dataset. You can find more information and download the dataset here : http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/
